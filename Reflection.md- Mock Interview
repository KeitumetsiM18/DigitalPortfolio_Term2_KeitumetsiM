# Reflection â€” Mock Interview (STAR)

**Situation:**  
During Term 2, I participated in a mock interview designed to simulate a real job interview environment.

**Task:**  
My goal was to practice how to introduce myself, answer behavioural and technical questions, and demonstrate professionalism and confidence.

**Action:**  
I prepared by researching common interview questions and rehearsing my answers using the STAR technique. During the mock interview, I focused on maintaining eye contact, clear communication, and appropriate posture. I recorded the session for later review.

**Result:**  
The experience helped me identify my strengths in communication and highlighted areas for improvement, such as pausing to think before answering. Overall, the mock interview increased my confidence and readiness for real-world interviews.
