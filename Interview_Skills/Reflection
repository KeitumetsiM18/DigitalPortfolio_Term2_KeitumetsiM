# Reflection â€” Interview Skills (STAR)

**Situation:**  
During Term 2, I completed the Interview Skills assessment, which tested my understanding of how to prepare for and perform confidently in job interviews.

**Task:**  
My objective was to demonstrate knowledge of common interview techniques, including how to answer behavioural questions and use the CAR method effectively.

**Action:**  
I studied interview preparation strategies, researched common interview questions, and practiced explaining my experiences using clear and structured responses. During the assessment, I applied these techniques to each question carefully.

**Result:**  
I achieved a complete score, showing that I understand how to prepare for interviews and answer professionally. This exercise helped me gain confidence in introducing myself, discussing my skills, and responding to difficult interview questions with honesty and clarity.
