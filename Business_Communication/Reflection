# Reflection â€” Business Communication (STAR)

**Situation:**  
During Term 2 of my Work Readiness Training, I completed an online Business Communication assessment that tested my understanding of professional communication in workplace settings.

**Task:**  
My goal was to apply knowledge of verbal, non-verbal, and written communication to answer questions about tone, etiquette, and professionalism.

**Action:**  
I reviewed the module lessons, completed the quiz, and analysed my responses to identify areas of improvement. I focused on using formal tone and correct structure in professional emails.

**Result:**  
I achieved full completion and improved my understanding of professional communication standards. This experience built my confidence in writing clear, respectful, and formal business messages.
